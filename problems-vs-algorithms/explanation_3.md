Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits

Provide an explanation for your answer, clearly organizing your thoughts into
concise and easy-to-understand language.

Focus on explaining the reasoning behind your decisions rather than giving a 
detailed description of the code. For instance, why did you choose a particular 
data structure? Additionally, discuss the efficiency of your solution in terms 
of time and space complexity. If necessary, you can support your explanation 
with code snippets or mathematical formulas. For guidance on how to write 
formulas in markdown, refer to https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions.
-->use of merge sort to get time complexity of O(nlogn) and result in descending order array which is used to rearranging numbers with odd and even places to get maximum sum.
